        <h2>About Byron Rice</h2>
        <p>
          Byron Rice has been a medical biller since September 1999 and a
          business owner since late 2007. When his mother needed surgery, Byron
          filled in for the two weeks that she was out of the dermatology
          practice where she was employed. It was there that Byron was
          introduced to medical billing. It seemed a natural fit as Byron was
          always good with numbers as well as following rules, guidelines,
          policy, and procedures. Following his two-week stint at the
          dermatology office, Byron was hired at a local billing service where
          he worked for a few months until he was hired away by Northwest
          Chiropractic Center (now part of VIDA Integrated Health) in Kirkland.
          During the course of his employment at NWCC, Byron worked in all
          aspects of business including office management (training for),
          billing, credentialing, and hiring (assisted). In December 2007, Byron
          opened his own billing service and made the move to full-time business
          owner in May 2008. Since that time, Byron has specialized in the
          reimbursement and management of alternative medicine providers;
          chiropractic, acupuncture, naturopath, and massage. His extensive work
          experience includes not only billing, but practice management and
          credentialing. His clients know him as a stickler for the rules and he
          believes that all three parties (patient, provider, insurance company)
          involved in the medical reimbursement process need to fulfill their
          responsibilities.

            "Byron has done medical billing and practice consulting for my
            chiropractic, acupuncture and naturopathic medical practice for the
            past 10 years. He is honest, methodical and diligent and has helped
            me to run my practice more efficiently as well as keep my cash flow
            consistent. I would highly recommend him as a medical biller and
            practice consultant."-- Multi-Specialty Provider in the greater

            "Byron Rice managed the medical billing for my Naturopathic and
            Acupuncture practice for XX years. Byron submits bills in a timely
            manner so that the practice can be reimbursed quickly. He is up to
            date with billing changes so that we don't waste time submitting
            incorrect claims. He has been in the business for a long time so has
            close contacts at the major insurance companies, so there is always
            someone to reach out to when there is a problem. He provides monthly
            billing statements so that you can stay on top of your receivables.
            Byron takes care of the business as it were his own. I am grateful
            for the care that he gave to my business over the years. There are
            many billers out there, but you would be hard to find another with
            such extensive expertise in natural medicine." Trina Seligman, N.D.,
